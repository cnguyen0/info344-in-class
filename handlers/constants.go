package handlers

const headerContentType = "Content-Type"
const accessControlAllowOrigin = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"

const contentTypeJSON = "application/json"
const contentTypeText = "text/plain"

// since its in the same package you can use it directly in the other files hahahah this is so cool
